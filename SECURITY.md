## Reporting a Vulnerability

Never report security-related issues, vulnerabilities, or bugs that include sensitive information to the issues page or anywhere else in public view. Instead, please report potentially security-sensitive bugs directly to the simDRIFT team at contact.simDRIFT@gmail.com. A member of the simDRIFT team will assess the risk(s) posed by the reported vulnerability and start work to address the issue as soon as possible. While a fix is in progress, regular updates will be provided to those who reported the issue only. Verified vulnerabilities, however, will be promptly announced on the documentation homepage. Patches for verified vulnerabilities will be released to the main branch and appropriate warnings will be supplied for outdated versions of simDRIFT.
