__gpuSimulation.py__

gpuSimulation.py is a high preformance diffusion MRI Monte Carlo Simulation libarary with allows users to simulate molecular diffusion in a $[0 \mu m \text{ , } 200\mu m]^{3}$ imaging voxel with: 2 fiber bundles with set-able volume fractions, intrinsic diffusivities, and crossing angles, and non-overlapping cells of 2 radii, each with a volume fraction, which either aggregate around the fibers or being penetrated by the fibers.

__Example Configurations__

Configurations are set in the following manner:
```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
```
