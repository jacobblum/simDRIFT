__gpuSimulation.py:__

gpuSimulation.py is a high preformance diffusion MRI Monte Carlo Simulation libarary with allows users to simulate molecular diffusion in a $[0 \mu m \text{ , } 50\mu m]^{3}$ imaging voxel with: 2 fiber bundles with set-able volume fractions, intrinsic diffusivities, and crossing angles, and non-overlapping cells of 2 radii, each with a volume fraction, which either aggregate in a 'void' between the two fiber bundles.

__Setting the intra-voxel tissue configuration:__

The tissue configuration is set using the config.ini setter code.
